When one travelles through a public transport, they may remedy their boredom by doing various things. Many places on this planet, it seems very likely that people dive into the world of digital contents. Videos, pictures and text made and written by other people they know or don't seem very popular for some reason. It seems the social networks have boosted the prospering of that sort of creation. What aspects of those contents or media make themselves so attractive and why people like to spend their time digesting those?

I think that the emergence of individualised devices connected to the World Wide Web contributed to this primarily. With a smartphone on your hand, you can access to different forms of content at your will, as long as your wireless data plan allows. You can watch a news about international economy, a video on my favourite video game, or a music video of a recently released song. Namely, you can use the Internet whenever you want or need to use. 

I would dare to throw these questions: What does the accessibility to information mean to human? 
Why we seek information so bad? 
How does our brain reward our act of acquiring information? 
Will there be any relation between psychological features and degree of dependency or vulnerability to be addicted to the action of information acquisition? What would be the features? Satisfaction or happiness? Mood?
